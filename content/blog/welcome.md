# Hey. I'm WorldWidePixel.

I decided to make a new website.

### Why?

a) The old code for my website was garbage and impossbile to update <br>
b) I wanted something new <br>
c) I wanted a better blog <br>
d) Don't you judge me <br>

I hope to make this a space where I can share things without the pressures of using actual social media.

### More to come soon!
