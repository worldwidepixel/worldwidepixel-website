_A mediocre blogpost from February. Read with embarrasment._

## MCPEDL is 10 years old.

Starting in 2014, MCPEDL is by far the most popular 3rd-party hosting service for community-created content. (Minecraft Marketplace is.... gross.)

Back in January, I helped port Pridepack, a semi-popular resource pack to the [Bedrock Edition](https://mcpedl.com/pridepack/) of the game. When discussing where to release it, our minds instantly went to MCPEDL. Then we realised why: it was the **only** option.

After release, we were quite surprised to see the comments. As of February, Modrinth does not support comments on projects, and this showed me why.

The above image is one of the many comments you can find on the page, which made us realise that MCPEDL has no useful kind of moderation.

### 2021, Overwolf acquisition

In the modding community, Overwolf has a [reputation of not exactly doing great](https://github.com/fractureiser-investigation/fractureiser) when it comes to moderation. In this case, they just don't and won't care about the clearly-intended-to-hard comments that _have_ been reported.

Don't support sites that don't put the effort into keeping their users and creators safe.
