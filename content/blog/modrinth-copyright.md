### Update

Modrinth does not enforce copyright infringement on projects as a cover-all policy, citing the complicated moderation troubles it would bring. This is a valid problem.

# What happens if you resdistribute music on Modrinth without permission?

I've been browsing the #new-projects channel of the Modrinth discord server a lot lately.

Now, most of these are interesting, and some (like the ones covered in this post), seem to be breaking copyright law.

## ThatMusicMan

I first found this creator while scrolling through the `new-projects` channel.
Joining eight months ago, they create resource packs that add music from various popular things into the game, such as _Guardians of the Galaxy_, _Portal_, and _Queen_.

Sounds great, right?
One problem: they clearly do not have the rights to this music, as made clear by messages at the bottom of their projects, for example "All songs are property of their respective artists."

While I have nothing against the creator of these projects, I do think it is the responsibity of Modrinth to prevent theft of music and other property, similar to these examples. Not enforcing copyright may put the entire Modrinth platform at risk.
