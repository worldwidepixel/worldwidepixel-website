### Happy new year.. almost!

I can't believe 2024 is already almost over.
I only feels like yesterday that I was mindlessly discussing how Alto was going to be amazing. How times have changed.

First: I am super grateful to so many people for making this year particularly amazing-- in no particular order,

-   blryface (extremely supportive and helpful)
-   callmeecho (very very good at making things)
-   devin (helped inspire me to make music)
-   encode42/erora (helped inspire me to make music)
-   rowandev (unbelievably helpful in creating bluerinth)
-   brewbraw (taught me what NPM was)
-   ktrain (has helped out with notessential and modwrapped)
-   hama (jack of all game design trades)
-   nulb (very very good at music production)
-   sake (great management skills)
-   theclashfruit (somehow kept CRSS working for over a year)
-   thinkseal (great betatester)
-   the entire Modrinth team (creates the platform that helped inspire me to make things)
-   the entire ModFest team (y'all are so good at being good people)

    _(if you're not on the list, It's not because you didn't make an impact- I'm just tired)_

The people and hell- dozens more have done the impossible job of inspiring creativity. And for that, I say thank you.

<hr>

Of course- at least personally- I feel like I owe some people an apology.
I've learned a **ridiculous** amount of stuff this year- but sometimes it takes a mistake to really make it stick.

I'm sorry to the many people who I've not been the kindest to. I'm sorry for being rather impatient (often), and I'm sorry for holding a double standard when it comes to people's good intentions.

While making a list feels inappropriate- I do want to use this new year as an opportunity to continue growing. It's the best I can do.

With that- I hope that 2025 can be even better than 2024, (but seeing the US election results, that's far from likely) and that I can continue doing what I love to do the most- making.

With lots of <3, WWP.

_Happy new year!_
