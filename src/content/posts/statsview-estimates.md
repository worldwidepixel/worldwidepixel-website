At the end of 2025, I am finally removing the estimate of creator revenue provided by StatsView. You might be wondering why, and the answer is simple.

It's been pretty much inaccurate from the start.

Essentially, I designed the calculations behind it in late 202**4** based on estimates that would produce a ballpark measure for *back then*. Since then, many changes and over a year have passed. It no longer provides any useful data.

Thus, I've decided to remove it.

Thank you for using StatsView! <3 lynn
