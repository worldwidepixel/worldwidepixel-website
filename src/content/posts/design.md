A couple days ago, I was asked this (rather intriguing) question on Bluesky:

<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ferdinandkeller.dev/post/3lyyanmnnes2l">
	<img alt="A Bluesky post. The post reads: I saw hollow modâ€™s icon @worldwidepixel.ca and really loved the design, it just feels nice. Did you make it? Any tip, especially on lighting/colors? I assumed it was made using Blender." src="/img/blog/design/screenshots/bluesky.png" />
</a>

Here's the answer I gave.

Hi!! Sorry for taking so long, and I'm so happy to hear you like the icon!!

The design of Hollow's icon is rather simple; it's what created my design system of isometric and vibrant icons, which can be seen across all Spirit projects.

<img alt="Vibrant icons of Spirit Studios projects, arranged in a sort-of rainbow." src="/img/blog/design/screenshots/inkscape.png" />

All Spirit-style icons are created in Blender, rendered isometrically, and then have their backgrounds added separately in Inkscape. This allows me to fine-tune the key colours long after the central element has been finalised.

A good example of the Spirit-style design process is with Snapper. I originally just did a rough sketch in Paint before trying to recreate it as best as I could in Minecraft. After that, I just 'traced' the build into Blockbench manually and exported the OBJ to Blender.

<img alt="A collage of the Snapper branding design process. From top left down: Snapper's colourful banner of an isometric diorama, the icon which has the same contents but only displayed once, a Paint sketch of this diorama, a Minecraft build of it, a Blockbench render of it, and lastly the transparent version of it, with no blue gradient background." src="/img/blog/design/snapper.png" />

If you're curious, the model for the logo is just repeatedly tiled and rendered again.

The banner is just a tiling of this model over the same background gradient.

One last interesting one is the logo for Cantilever. It's actually a mix of two separate renders, in order to create both parts of the optical illusion. Once done, I just merged them! (they overlapped, so it was simple)

Hope this was an interesting read! The original thread can be read [here](https://bsky.app/profile/worldwidepixel.ca/post/3lz5rfa2nic27).
