# Hi.

Things haven't been great, recently.
Things have also been amazing, recently.

Life is complicated sometimes.

If you're here and think I'm about to detail any specifics, you are very much mistaken. I know better than to dump my feelings onto the eyes of the Internet.

I've spent the past few months helping out with BlanketCon '25, a Minecraft modding convention. I've mainly been busy with the original soundtrack (see the previous [ModFest 1.21](https://worldwidepixel.ca/music/release/modfest-121-time-technology-throwbacks-original-modpack-soundtrack)) and various website improvements. Music, for me, has very rapidly became one of my favourite creative outlets. It's gone from a fun side project to one of the only works that can bring me joy, and not stress. I am very grateful to the ModFest team for giving me these opportunities to create for their events.

Even with this, though, some stress can still shine through. When this ever-so-conveniently matches with some... let's say "great" mental health, it can be multiplied into something to be fearful of. Earlier this year, I made the very tough decision to leave the Vital team. Part of this was because of my different views on how the NotEssential project should be managed, but it was mainly due to the stress caused of having the be the "NotEssential person." Stress is something I am working very hard to minimise in my works, not increase. I give my best to the Vital team and wish them the very best in the future.

I don't know what I'm trying to say here. Mainly, that I might be less willing to put together a Bluerinth update, or finally rewrite Badger. I want to focus on the projects that currently help relieve some of the pressures I'm under at the moment.

I apologise if I slip up every once and a while and reaffirm to the world that I am human. Humans need breaks.

This doesn't mean I will be disappearing, or slowing down the release of anything in specific. I just want to make clear that I'm not operating on 100% constantly anymore.

Thank you for understanding, I hope.

With <3, WWP.
