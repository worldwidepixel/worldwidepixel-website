## From respectably ridiculous to properly pretty, this is 366.

Happy 2025, and thank you.

This year has been an incredible journey, and I can't help but be infinitely grateful to the many people who have helped me along the way. Being one of my 'December projects' this year, all music composed in this album was made this month. Even so, I've tried to venture out into new musical territories with this project. From respectably ridiculous to properly pretty, this is 366. I hope this coming year is even better than the last!

<3, WWP
