## You've got to start somewhere.

The original soundtrack for Spirit Studios' Hollow, and my first release.

Will always hold a special place in my heart.

### Song notes

**Wildflower** is the first track made for Hollow. Even though the project file has been lost (or more accurately, ruined), I am lucky to have relatively high quality versions of the song that were able to be used. Out of sheer luck, I think it projects the vibe of "hollowness" perfectly. Here's [and old work-in-progress mix](/misc/oldflower.mp3) of it.

**Waterlily** (this W trend is odd, isn't it?) was made soon after. The song plays in the Swamp, and is meant to bring yet again a sense of calm. In hindsight, it should have been longer.

**Echo** is creepy ambience. No doubt about it. Not much to say, though I think a cello appears in there somewhere?

**Postmortem** is a beam of light in the darkness- you've managed to find the treasure! While the song itself is a bit of a winding road, you eventually find yourself back home.
