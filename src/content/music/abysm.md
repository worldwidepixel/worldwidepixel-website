## Something stirs in the depths. Its call demands an answer.

My first album, sort of.

Abysm is both the soundtrack to (an outstanding) Spirit Studios mod (which can be found [here](https://modrinth.com/mod/abysm)) and an audio portait of my life over the past many months. Over those months, I've been rather obsessed with the underwater music of Minecraft, and to a lesser extent Subnautica. When I had the opportunity to write the soundtrack for Abysm, I was excited to finally satisfy my urge to produce more music for this part of the world (after doing a bit for BlanketCon '25).

### Song notes

**Paddleboard** starts us off. Inspired by a summer day (that I genuinely spent part of on a paddleboard), I had the urge to make something that makes you feel- even if not underwater, still joyful in nature.

**Korallenflieder** is the introduction to what's under the depths. Originally made as a demo of sorts before development time begun on Abysm, it is notably not present in the mod itself (though it is one of my favourites!)

**Wake** was the first song I completed after purchasing Ableton Live. I had been on-and-off considering purchasing a 'proper' DAW for montths before this- but some business practices by BandLab were what ultimately made me jump ship from Cakewalk. This song makes use of none of my 'regular' instruments, as I composed and mastered this song entirely on my MacBook. I personally feel like it's the closest I got to the Subnautica vibe.

**Cichlid** is the song of the Floral Reef. Meant to be playful and adventurous, the song feels almost like a triumphant battle? I got to finally make use of Bartok pizzicato in this song- something I had been wanting to do for _ages_ before this.

**Renaissance** is the one and only disc in Abysm, meant to represent a time before the Deep Sea Ruins was... well, ruins. I tried to pull vibes from what I imagined as the typical 'everything is amazing and okay' sound. (sort of around the 80s?) Because I'm me, it also uses a bunch of orchestral elements. Actually, I don't think any song in Abysm doesn't.

**Colossal Codecs** is what the Deep Sea Ruins are today- while you may be first in awe of its majesty and scale, you soon realise its past is much darker than it seems. I'd say this is a good example of how I've used this project to properly learn mixing of strings/orchestral elements.

**Abysm** takes you even deeper. Gone are remnants of what's gone- all that is left is the abyss. It's the longest song I've ever made that has actually made it to release of a project. I also got to try some new choir sounds!

**Tilapia** is my favourite song from Abysm. Meant to be a general 'emotionally neutral' song for all places in the ocean, I think its odd time signature and "melody" makes is quite joyful. I also got to try out a new guitar-ish sound, too. You can also hear this in Antiquity!

**No** was composed and mastered in about two hours when I was creating a continous set of Abysm for release on YouTube. It's meant to say goodbye to a project that has taken up quite a large place in my heart. I hope we can see each other again soon.
