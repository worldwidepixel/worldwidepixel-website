## Everything that doesn't 'belong' somewhere. Full of failures, rejects, and firsts.

My first experiments- actually, my first songs.

### Song notes

**missing** **burst** and **amphitheatre** were created for the sake of making things- actually, they were my first tracks altogether. (they are ordered in the release chronologically.) Around that time, I had found an old tape recorder and thought it would be fun to play around with (it was), so I used it in some music. I'm still quite fond of **missing**.

**rumble** and **prenuptial** were some early (and rather wacky) tracks for Spirit Studios- before it even had that name. **rumble** was originally going to be a disc included alongside the ModFest: Carnival release of Bombastic, but it did not fit the project vibe and was cut. **prenuptial** was created as an April Fools' joke to be included in Hollow as a disc. Soon after this, we implemented **Postmortem**. (I wonder if it uses the same code...)
