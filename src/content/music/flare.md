## Everything that doesn't 'belong' somewhere. Full of failures, rejects, and firsts.

My first experiments- actually, my first songs.

"missing", "burst", and "amphitheatre" were what helped me really get my first footing into creating music. Meanwhile, \"rumble\" and \"prenuptial\" were some early (and rather wacky) tracks for Spirit Studios- before it even had that name. While very silly, I hope someone can find the feeling in this that I put into these tracks when I first made them. And hopefully, you can get a laugh out of it too.
