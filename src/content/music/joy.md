## You know what? Why not make something lovely?

6 months in the making; Joy. A learning experience, if anything: this project helped me gain a deeper understanding of music production. Of course, that's not the only reason it's here. I hope this project satiates my need to make something just.. lovely.

Something to curl up to, something to love.
Something to feel Joy about.

### Song notes

**Joy** is the title track- what starts it all. The intention behind it is simple; be joyful.

**Mélancolie** is the opposite- more mysterious and dramatic.

**Reminiscence** is meant to slow you down- I'd say it's essentially a lullaby. Not a bad thing, though.

**Douglas** is my favourite song from this project. It's meant to return to that theme of utter joy- and nostalgia.

**Regina** was originally made for ModFest 1.21, decided it would work better here. I'm happy I made that decision.
