## You know what? Why not make something lovely?

6 months in the making; Joy. A learning experience, if anything: this project helped me gain a deeper understanding of music production. Of course, that's not the only reason it's here. I hope this project satiates my need to make something just.. lovely.

Something to curl up to, something to love.
Something to feel Joy about.
